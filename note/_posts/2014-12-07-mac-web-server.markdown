{% highlight bash %}
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
{% endhighlight %}

You may want to change the port if you already have something running on 8000, but other than that the command doesn't require much alteration. It's a great little snippet to keep in mind (or in your TextExpander shortcuts) for the next time you need a quick little web server.

{% highlight bash %}
$ ifconfig en0
{% endhighlight %}

Check local IP address.
